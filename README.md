# BigInteger-Implementation
A program that supports plus, minus, multiplication and division arithmetic operations for unlimited integers.<br />
That is, the limit that exists in java for the maximum value of integers (2^31-1 = 2147483647) does not exist for this class.<br />
The BIGINT class was written entirely without the use of the parseInt function of the String class,<br />
and no built-in arithmetic operations of Integera were used at all except for a single digit (between 0-9).<br />
In addition, it implements the 'Comparable' interface, so 2 isntances of BigInt can be compared.<br />
The program get as input 2 strings of infinite numbers, and presents to the user the result of using all the arithmetic operations for these 2 BigInts.<br />
